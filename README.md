# JARVIS
The project includes an implementation of an intelligent voice recognition assistant for laptop OS. Working out all the necessary functions with help of voice based commands. 
One can easily use the uploaded files and design their own assistant and can implement more of the functionalities by researching more on it.

P.S: PLEASE MAKE SURE NOT TO COPY PASTE AS IT IS, IT ONLY LIMITS YOUR CREATIVITY.
ALL THE BEST!!
